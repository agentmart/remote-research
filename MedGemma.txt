# MedGemma: Medical Language Model

MedGemma is a medical large language model (LLM) developed by Google. It's derived from the Gemma family of open models but specifically trained and fine-tuned on medical data to enable healthcare applications.

## Model Variants
- MedGemma is available in multiple sizes (including 7B parameter version)
- Comes in both base and instruction-tuned variants

## Where to Use MedGemma

1. **Hugging Face**: 
   - The model is available through the Hugging Face platform
   - Access at huggingface.co/google/medgemma-7b and similar repositories
   - Requires authentication with a Hugging Face account

2. **Google Cloud Platform**:
   - Can be deployed through Vertex AI
   - Useful for enterprise medical applications with proper compliance controls

3. **Local Deployment**:
   - Compatible with standard LLM frameworks like Transformers
   - Can be run on consumer hardware (high-end GPUs recommended)
   - Smaller variants work with limited resources

4. **Research Environments**:
   - Ideal for academic and clinical research
   - Can be used in educational settings with proper agreements

## Usage Limitations
- Requires acceptance of model license terms
- Not intended for direct clinical decision-making without human oversight
- Should be used in compliance with healthcare data regulations (HIPAA, etc.)

## Ethical Considerations
- Trained on medical literature and data with appropriate permissions
- Users should be aware of potential biases and limitations
- Not a replacement for medical professionals

Note: Always check the latest documentation and license requirements when implementing MedGemma in any environment.
